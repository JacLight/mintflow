pnpm nx generate @nx/js:library --name=my-new-plugin --directory=packages/plugins/my-new-plugin --importPath=@mintflow/plugins/my-new-plugin --projectNameAndRootFormat=as-provided --no-interactive

Thank you to all our contributors and the open-source community!

so we hvae mintflow plugins inside plugins folder the task

1. for each __ref_only -- plugin create a mintflow plutins, we might need to change the name a little i.e when they say switch we might say decition, you can prompt me during the new plugin creation for name .

to assist you in creating plugins as the root of the mono repo you can run

pnpm generate:template {{name of plugins}}. -- this will create the blank plugins template in ./plugins/{plugingname}}

this is pnpm base project

2. afer this weill you looks at the implmentation of _ref_only then implment similar in the new plugin following our plugins achitecteture.

3. YOu can look into existing plugsin to learn about our plugins achitechtion

4. you need to know that the structure of ___ref_only plugins is not the same with mintflow plugins, inface nothnig can be directly copied without outright rewrting from scrapte. everthing you do must be rewritting or reimagines so that fit well into mintflow plugin ecoho system

5. Please add a readme to the github plugins, features, useage and any other importatn stuffs

6. please ignore plugins already implemented

7. update the plugin_mapping.md documentation with the new plugihn

8. sure we go ahead but I really dont like having too many plugins doing little things each, I'll apprecaite every oppopuniy to merge small plugs into one let me know when you find a condidate

9 kindly look into the array plug for test configuration.

10. When adding test kindly add them incrementally so you know it works before the next test. use npx jest in the plug folder to test

11. the testing framwork is jest, look in array plugin for guidance, you're not done untill all test passing

kindly look in the plugins folder __ref_only and plugins remove the thing inside__ref_only that we've have implmented someimee you need to look into the actual implmentation to effective do this becase naems of plug alone is not enoug and sometime plug were merged

update the pending_plugins.md and Plugin_mapping.md

then remove the reference from __ref_only
