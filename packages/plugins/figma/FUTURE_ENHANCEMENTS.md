  "token": "your-figma-api-token",
  "fileKey": "file-key-from-url",
  "nodeId": "optional-node-id", // Convert specific node or entire file
  "format": "html", // or "react", "flutter"
  "options": {
    "cssFramework": "tailwind", // Optional: tailwind, bootstrap, none
    "reactFramework": "next", // Optional: next, create-react-app, none
    "stateManagement": "hooks", // Optional: hooks, redux, context
    "responsiveBreakpoints": [640, 768, 1024, 1280] // Optional
  }
}
```

```javascript
{
  "action": "ai_convert_to_code",
  "token": "your-figma-api-token",
  "fileKey": "file-key-from-url",
  "nodeId": "optional-node-id",
  "targetFormat": "react", // html, flutter, vue, angular, etc.
  "aiOptions": {
    "model": "gpt-4-vision", // or other vision-capable models
    "codeStyle": "functional", // functional, class-based, etc.
    "optimizationLevel": "production", // draft, production, performance
    "designSystemMapping": { /* custom mapping to your design system */ },
    "includeComments": true, // add explanatory comments
    "generateTests": false // optionally generate test files
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Multi-Stage AI Pipeline

1. **Design Analysis Stage**:
   - Extract design data using Figma API
   - Use vision models to analyze the visual hierarchy and relationships
   - Generate a semantic representation of the design

2. **Code Planning Stage**:
   - Determine optimal component structure
   - Plan state management approach
   - Identify reusable patterns

3. **Code Generation Stage**:
   - Generate framework-specific code
   - Apply code style and best practices
   - Optimize for performance and maintainability

4. **Refinement Stage**:
   - Validate generated code
   - Optimize for edge cases
   - Add documentation and comments

### 2.4 Advanced AI Features

- **Interactive Refinement**: Allow users to iteratively refine generated code through natural language instructions
- **Design System Learning**: Train AI on specific design systems to improve accuracy
- **Code Customization**: Generate variations with different coding styles or patterns
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implement feedback mechanisms to improve conversion quality

## 3. Component Extraction Methodology

### 3.1 Hierarchical Analysis Process

1. **Identify Page Sections**: Analyze top-level frames to identify major sections
2. **Detect Repeating Patterns**: Use pattern recognition to identify repeated elements
3. **Establish Component Boundaries**: Determine component boundaries based on:
   - Explicit Figma components
   - Spatial grouping
   - Visual containment
   - Functional relationships

### 3.2 Component Classification System

- **Layout Components**: Structural elements that organize content
- **UI Components**: Interactive elements (buttons, inputs, toggles)
- **Content Components**: Information-displaying elements (cards, lists)
- **Composite Components**: Complex combinations (forms, search bars)
- **Page Sections**: Larger units combining multiple components

### 3.3 Relationship Mapping

- **Parent-Child Relationships**: How components nest within each other
- **Sibling Relationships**: How adjacent components relate
- **State Relationships**: How components change based on interaction states
- **Data Flow**: How information might flow between components

### 3.4 Multi-Pass Analysis Algorithm

```
function analyzeDesign(figmaFile) {
  // First pass: Identify all potential components
  const candidateComponents = identifyCandidateComponents(figmaFile);
  
  // Second pass: Consolidate similar components
  const consolidatedComponents = consolidateSimilarComponents(candidateComponents);
  
  // Third pass: Establish component hierarchy
  const componentHierarchy = buildComponentHierarchy(consolidatedComponents);
  
  // Fourth pass: Extract component properties and variants
  const componentLibrary = extractComponentProperties(componentHierarchy);
  
  return {
    componentLibrary,
    componentHierarchy,
    pageStructure: derivePageStructure(componentHierarchy)
  };
}
```

### 3.5 Component Extraction Criteria

For each potential component, evaluate:

- **Reusability Score**: How likely is this element to be reused?
- **Complexity Score**: How complex is this element internally?
- **Isolation Score**: How independent is this element from its surroundings?
- **Consistency Score**: How consistent is this element with design system patterns?

### 3.6 Code Generation Strategy

1. **Generate from Bottom Up**: Start with atomic components, then compose them
2. **Apply Design System Mapping**: Map components to existing design system if available
3. **Generate Component API**: Create props/parameters based on variants and states
4. **Build Page Assembly Code**: Generate code that assembles components into full views

## 4. Technical Implementation Considerations

### 4.1 Edge Cases Handling

- **Overlapping Elements**: Determine whether overlaps are intentional design features or layout issues
- **Inconsistent Spacing**: Normalize spacing or preserve intentional irregularities
- **Custom Graphics**: Decide whether to export as images or recreate with code
- **Complex Interactions**: Capture interaction details from prototype information

### 4.2 Optimization Opportunities

- **Deduplicate Similar Components**: Identify components that are slight variations and consolidate
- **Extract Shared Styles**: Identify common styles that should be extracted to variables
- **Identify Responsive Patterns**: Detect how designs adapt across breakpoints

### 4.3 Integration with Existing Tools
