# QuickBooks-Migrate Plugin for MintFlow

The QuickBooks-Migrate plugin is designed to facilitate the migration of data from QuickBooks to other accounting platforms. This plugin complements the standard QuickBooks plugin by providing specialized export and data mapping capabilities.

## Purpose

Many businesses need to migrate from QuickBooks to other accounting platforms for various reasons:

- Cost considerations
- Feature requirements
- Scalability needs
- Integration capabilities
- Compliance requirements
- User experience preferences

This plugin simplifies the migration process by providing standardized export formats and platform-specific data mappings.

## Planned Features

### Data Export Utilities

1. **Export to Standard Formats**
   - Export data to CSV format with configurable field mappings
   - Export data to Excel format with multiple worksheets for different entity types
   - Export data to JSON format with nested relationships preserved

2. **Platform-Specific Export**
   - Format data specifically for Xero import
   - Format data specifically for Zoho Books import
   - Format data specifically for Invoice Ninja import
   - Format data specifically for FreshBooks import

### Data Mapping Utilities

1. **Chart of Accounts Mapping**
   - Map QuickBooks chart of accounts to target platform structure
   - Preserve account hierarchies and relationships
   - Handle account type differences between platforms

2. **Tax Code Mapping**
   - Map QuickBooks tax codes to target platform tax codes
   - Handle complex tax scenarios and rates
   - Preserve tax groups and relationships

3. **Customer/Vendor Field Mapping**
   - Map QuickBooks customer and vendor fields to target platform fields
   - Handle custom fields and additional information
   - Preserve contact relationships and hierarchies

### Data Validation

1. **Pre-Migration Validation**
   - Identify potential issues before migration
   - Validate data integrity and completeness
   - Check for unsupported features or data types

2. **Post-Migration Verification**
   - Verify data consistency after migration
   - Compare financial reports between platforms
   - Identify and resolve discrepancies

### Migration Workflows

Pre-built workflows for common migration scenarios:
- QuickBooks to Xero migration workflow
- QuickBooks to Zoho Books migration workflow
- QuickBooks to Invoice Ninja migration workflow
- QuickBooks to FreshBooks migration workflow

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Xero Migration

**Key Differences:**

## Common Migration Challenges

### Data Structure Differences
- Chart of accounts structure varies between platforms
- Tax handling differs significantly (especially international)
- Custom fields may not have direct equivalents
- Transaction history and audit trails may be handled differently

### Historical Data Preservation
- Maintaining transaction history
- Preserving audit trails
- Handling attachments and documents
- Retaining custom data and notes

### Financial Reporting Consistency

- Dealing with recurring transactions

## Implementation Timeline

This plugin is planned for development after the completion of the standard QuickBooks plugin. The implementation will be phased:

1. **Phase 1: Core Export Utilities**
   - Standard format exports (CSV, Excel, JSON)
   - Basic data validation

2. **Phase 2: Data Mapping Utilities**
   - Chart of accounts mapping
   - Tax code mapping
   - Customer/vendor field mapping

3. **Phase 3: Platform-Specific Exports**
   - Xero-specific export
   - Zoho Books-specific export
   - Invoice Ninja-specific export
   - FreshBooks-specific export

4. **Phase 4: Migration Workflows**
   - Pre-built migration workflows
   - Post-migration verification tools
   - Migration reporting
